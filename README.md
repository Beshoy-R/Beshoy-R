- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Beshoy-R .. a software developer who is enthusiastic about all things about programming.

I have built projects using a range of technologies and platforms, including but not limited to mobile applications, embedded systems, and desktop applications, 
both as a student and for customers.

I'm open to trying new things and using new technology. I'm seeking opportunities that will allow me to learn new things & be more creative.
